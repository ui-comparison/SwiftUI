## Development Experience

Most of the code is generated by Xcode. Only the
[ContentView.swift](./ui-comparison-SwiftUI/ContentView.swift) file was manually adjusted.

Xcode offers a configurable, instant UI preview, but does not offer a RAD style drag-and-drop
interface to add and place components.

It has a very expansive [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui), though
it is ordered very strangely. The list of controls is pretty far down, which made me think they
don't have them at all. The order of topics prioritizes how to put your UI into a VR space over how
to create a toolbar.

The documentation seems well supported by Apple Developer videos and a lot of third party tutorial
content.

Searching for "Swift" often brought up incorrect results for me because of a name collision with
the European banking system and its specifications.
